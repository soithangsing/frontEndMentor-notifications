## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first project after taking a short break from coding. I had to really break off the rust for this one. 

I really manipulated the DOM using this project. Had me google a lot for answers. Adding the dot after every unread notification was a bit tricky because I had to append and then remove a span element based on whether the notification was read or not. After adding the dot, I encountered a bug which made the notification counter go down if we kept pressing a recently read notification, which I fixed by running the event handler only once.  

I made the background-color, red dot and the notification counter dependent on a single class of '.unread' and establishing that link is what the JS code is based around. 

Writing CSS was easy.


### Continued development

I would like to take some time to refactor my code because as of now, I leave it as soon as it works. 

I also want more projects to fiddle with the DOM and APIs as I believe they are integral to becoming a fully-fledged front-end developer.
